We are a welcoming Christian community in Toledo, Ohio, seeking to follow Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit, equipping disciples to build up the Kingdom of God. 

Each Sunday, we gather to:

- üôè **pray**,
- üôå **worship**,
- üìñ **hear the Bible read and preached**,
- üçûüç∑ **celebrate the [Holy Eucharist](https://www.episcopalchurch.org/glossary/eucharist/)** (also known as Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper).  

We also have a special **service for children during the 10:30 AM service**, where they can learn about God's love in a fun and engaging way.
