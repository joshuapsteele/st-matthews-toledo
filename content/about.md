# What We Believe

## Our Mission
**To know Christ and to make Him known.**

St. Matthew's Toledo is a welcoming Christian community committed to this calling. We are part of the historic Anglican tradition, which traces its roots back to the Early Church through the Church of England and continues the apostolic faith handed down through the centuries.

## Our Anglican Heritage
As Anglicans, we embrace the "via media" - a faithful middle way that maintains both catholic substance and evangelical truth. Our faith is grounded in the foundational documents that have shaped Anglican Christianity for centuries:

- **The Book of Common Prayer** (including the 1662 Catechism) - our guide for worship, doctrine, and spiritual formation
- **The Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion** - our doctrinal standards defining Anglican teaching
- **The Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral** - the four essentials of Christian faith and order

These documents, rooted in Scripture and tested by time, continue to shape our understanding of God's truth and our common life together.

## Our Faith

### The Foundation: Holy Scripture
We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments contain "all things necessary to salvation" and serve as "the rule and ultimate standard of faith." Scripture is the inspired Word of God and the ultimate authority for all matters of faith and practice.

### The Historic Creeds
We affirm the historic creeds of the church as "the sufficient statement of the Christian faith":
- **The Apostles' Creed** - our baptismal symbol
- **The Nicene Creed** - our comprehensive statement of orthodox Christian belief
- **The Athanasian Creed** - our declaration of Trinitarian faith

These creeds, as the 1662 Catechism teaches us, "may be proved by most certain warrants of Holy Scripture."

### The Trinity
We worship one God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - "of one substance, power, and eternity." This foundational doctrine shapes our understanding of God's nature and His relationship with humanity.

### Salvation by Grace Through Faith
Following the Thirty-Nine Articles, we believe "we are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or deservings." Salvation is God's gift, received through faith alone, by grace alone, in Christ alone.

### The Sacraments
We celebrate the two sacraments "ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel":
- **Holy Baptism** - "a sign of Regeneration or New-Birth" and entry into Christ's Church
- **Holy Communion (Eucharist)** - "for the continual remembrance of the sacrifice of the death of Christ, and of the benefits which we receive thereby"

As our Catechism teaches, these are "outward and visible signs of inward and spiritual grace given unto us, ordained by Christ himself."

### The Church and Holy Orders
We believe in the "one holy catholic and apostolic Church" - the universal body of all believers. The visible Church is "a congregation of faithful men, in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ's ordinance." 

We maintain the Historic Episcopate - the threefold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons - as one of the four essential elements of the Church's order, "locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of God into the Unity of His Church."

### The Moral Law
We embrace the Ten Commandments as God's moral law, learning from them our "duty towards God" and our "duty towards our Neighbour." As the Catechism teaches, our duty toward God is "to believe in him, to fear him, and to love him with all my heart, with all my mind, with all my soul, and with all my strength."

## Our Worship
Our worship follows the historic Anglican liturgy found in the Book of Common Prayer, connecting us to centuries of faithful Christian tradition. Each Sunday we gather to:
- **Pray** together, including the Lord's Prayer which our Saviour taught us
- **Worship** through traditional hymns, psalms, and liturgical responses
- **Hear God's Word** through the systematic reading of Scripture and biblical preaching
- **Celebrate Holy Communion** as the central act of our corporate worship

## Our Community
We welcome people from all walks of life to join us in worship and fellowship. Whether you're new to faith, returning to church, or have been a Christian for years, you'll find a place at St. Matthew's Toledo.

We believe that following Jesus requires both personal faith and communal life. We encourage one another in faith, serve our neighbors in love, and seek to fulfill our duty "to love, honour, and succour" one another as we build up the Kingdom of God.

## Our Pastor
**Father Zeke Coughlin, Rector**

Father Zeke leads our community with pastoral care, biblical teaching, and a heart for evangelism and discipleship. As our rector, he is committed to helping each member of our congregation grow in their relationship with Jesus Christ and in their understanding of the Anglican way.
