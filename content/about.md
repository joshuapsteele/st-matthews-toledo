## Our Mission
**To know Christ and to make Him known.**

This simple calling is at the heart of everything we do. It means growing in our relationship with Jesus Christ and sharing His love with others.

This mission belongs to every Christian and every church. We believe the Anglican way of following Christ—with its rich tradition of worship, theology, and pastoral care—provides a beautiful and faithful way to fulfill this calling.

## Our Anglican Tradition

As Anglicans, we follow a "middle way" that balances both catholic tradition and evangelical truth. We're part of the historic Anglican tradition that traces back to the Early Church through the Church of England.

Our church is a member of the [Anglican Diocese of the Great Lakes](https://www.adgl.us/) and the [Anglican Church in North America](https://www.anglicanchurch.net/).

## Our Worship

Our worship follows the historic Anglican liturgy from [the Book of Common Prayer](https://bcp2019.anglicanchurch.net/). 

Each Sunday we gather to:
- **Pray** together, including confessing our sins and praying the Lord's Prayer
- **Worship** through traditional hymns, modern songs, psalms, and liturgy
- **Hear God's Word** through Scripture readings and biblical preaching
- **Celebrate Holy Communion** as the central act of our worship

## Our Community

We welcome people from all walks of life. Whether you're new to faith, returning to church, or have been a Christian for years, you'll find a place at St. Matthew's Anglican Church.

We believe following Jesus requires both personal faith and community life. We encourage one another in faith, serve our neighbors in love, and seek to build up the Kingdom of God together.

## Our Pastor

**Father Zeke Coughlin, Rector**

Father Zeke leads our community with pastoral care, biblical teaching, and a heart for discipleship. He is committed to helping each member grow in their relationship with Jesus Christ and in understanding the Anglican way.
